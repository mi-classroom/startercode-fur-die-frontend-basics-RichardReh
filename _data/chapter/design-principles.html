    <titel>Design Methods</titel>
    <p>After discussing the design principles necessary for a good user experience, this section elaborates on specific
        ways to approach the design process.</p>

    <subtitel>Community-Centered Design</subtitel>
    <p>It is important to provide members within a community the opportunity to interact with each other (PREECES, 2004,
        P. 3FF). According to Preece, developing online communities is different from designing software as software,
        once shipped, is stable and does not change until the next update while online communities develop and change
        through dynamic interactions. It is first and foremost a social experience that changes according to who is
        participating, the number of people involved, and the type of discussion that takes place (IBID., P.4). For
        example, the dynamics between new and long-established communities differ notably. While the software might not
        change drastically, social interactions will adapt according to the growth of the community. This social
        adaption is called “sociability” (IBID.).
        <br>

        In many online communities, these social changes are at least as influential as software changes. Therefore,
        crucial to not only focus on the usability of the design but also on sociability. Therefore, knowledge from
        different disciplines such as sociology, social psychology, anthropology, as well as user-centered design is
        required (IBID.). In participatory community-centered design methodology (→ FIG. 07), members of the community
        are involved in the design process from the beginning. In community-centered design, six phases are each
        followed by an evaluation period and iterations based on the findings.

    <br>

    <subtitel>Assess the Needs of the Community</subtitel>
    <p>The first step involves understanding the community. This means understanding the community’s needs. It is
        important to understand who the members of the community are and what the main purpose of the community is. It
        is
        about understanding for whom this community exists and what the participants’ habits are</p>
    <cite>(PREECE, 2004, P. 4).</cite>

    <br>

    <subtitel>Select a Technology Plan for Sociability</subtitel>
    <p>After understanding the potential members of the community, it is important to select the technology for
        communication within the community. Suitable mediums, such as timelines, discussion boards, or chat areas, must
        be discussed and the software should be tailored to suit the needs of the community</p>
    <cite>(PREECE, 2004, P. 4F.).</cite>

    <br>

    <subtitel>Test Prototype</subtitel>
    <p>Step three requires testing of the prototype with the potential members of the community. The intended software
        and sociability structures need to be validated at a basic level. This validation includes the representation of
        social policies and social interactions. For example, if members must complete a registration policy before
        joining the community, its comprehensibility must be ensured. In this step, iterative changes are made according
        to the user feedback</p>
    <cite>(PREECE, 2004, P. 5).</cite>

    <br>

    <subtitel>Test Sociability and Usability</subtitel>
    <p>Step four extends the testing made in step three and focuses on validating the design choices for good user
        experience and sociability. The usability, user interface, and the feel of the interaction are tested with the
        user. At this stage, substantial emphasis is laid on the overall user experience.</p>
    <cite>(PREECE, 2004, P. 5).</cite>

    <br>

    <subtitel>Nurture the Community</subtitel>
    <p>After establishing the basis for the online community, the final step consists of nurturing the community. It is
        the most important process as long as the community exists, since nurturing the community allows new members to
        feel welcomed and supported, thus enabling growth. Furthermore, the community must be well advertised, so that
        this growth can continue over a long period of time</p>
    <cite>(PREECE, 2004, P. 5F.).</cite>

    <br>

    <p>A community-centered design process is crucial to a community’s life cycle, as it ensures that members of respective
    communities are heard. This assurance allows the design to adapt and change based on their ideas, desires, and
    needs. Designing for online communities is iterative by nature and should reflect the community’s evolution</p>
    <cite>(IBID., P. 6).</cite>



    <h1>Human-Centered Design</h1>
    <br>
    <p>A design process can be approached in numerous ways. The previously mentioned community-centered design process
        is tailored specifically towards online communities and how members interact with each other. The problem,
        however, is that factoring in the unanimous behavior of a large group may result in neglect of an individual’s
        personal experience with the product. A more personal and empathetic approach is that of human-centered design
        (HCD).
        <br>
        HCD factors in the emotional and psychological preferences of the individual. According to Norman, this approach
        that “puts human needs, capabilities, and behavior first, then designs to accommodate those needs, capabilities,
        and ways of behaving” <cite>(NORMAN, 2013, P. 8).</cite> HCD puts the individual experience with the product
        first,
        considering the whole user experience <cite>(IXDF - UCD, N.D.).</cite> Norman describes HCD as a philosophy that
        starts with
        understanding humans and their needs and difficulties through observation. Since people often do not realize
        their own needs, it is the designers’ responsibility to observe and define them <cite>(NORMAN, 2013, P.
            9).</cite>

        There are four different phases in HCD <cite>(→ FIG. 08).</cite>

    <br>


    <subtitel>Observation</subtitel>


    <p>Observation is the phase in which the user’s situation and the underlying problem that needs to be solved are
        researched by the designers. To understand the people for whom the solution is intended, one must observe them
        in
        their daily lives to fully understand their environment, the daily problems they encounter, and their goals.
        Furthermore, the current market offer is explored to determine how the problem has been approached by others
        <cite>(NORMAN, 2013, P. 222F.).</cite>
    </p>

    <br>
    <subtitel>Ideation</subtitel>

    <p>Through ideation, potential solutions for the given problem are explored. Based on the insights gained in the
        research phase, various ideas are accumulated to select the best solution for the given problem. It is important
        that no idea is discarded or focused on too early, as creative variety is the essence of ideation <cite>(NORMAN,
            2013,
            P. 226).</cite></p>

    <subtitel>Prototyping</subtitel>

    <p>After the ideas are prototyped, they become tangible so that they can be tested later. Since feedback is crucial
        in the early stages of the design process, prototypes contain only the core functionality of the product with
        the relevant components that need validation. Prototypes demonstrate the real product <cite>(NORMAN, 2013, P.
            227F.).</cite>
    </p>

    <subtitel>Testing</subtitel>

    <p>Testing the prototypes with real users who correspond closely to the target demographic uncovers weaknesses and
        strengths of the concept. Assumptions made up to this point can be confirmed or refuted. Furthermore, the
        insights gathered throughout this phase are used to shape the subsequent iterations, thus improving the solution
        in the process <cite>(NORMAN, 2013, P. 228F.).</cite>
        <br>
        <br>
        These four phases are repeated constantly until the solution fulfills potential. HCD is an iterative process in
        which each iteration produces more insight, bringing the solution closer to its goal. The result is a product
        that resonates more deeply with the target audience (NORMAN, 2013 P. 229F.). HCD might also be called
        user-centered design <cite>(W3C - UCD, N.D.).</cite>>
    </p>

    <blockquote>»Human-centered design is a philosophy, not a precise set of methods, but one that assumes that
        innovation should start by getting close to users and observing their activities.«
        > <cite>– Don Norman</cite></blockquote>

    <br>
    <subtitel>Design Thinking</subtitel>
    <br>

    <img src="../images/design-thinking.png">

    <p>Design thinking is a process that, similarly to HCD, is centered on the user. The difference, however, lies in
        its end goal. HCD is a creative approach that solves known problems by gaining a deep understanding of and
        empathy for the target demographic <cite>(IDEO, N.D.)</cite>. According to Michael Burmester, the ultimate goal
        of HCD is to
        ensure high usability and good user experience with digital interfaces <cite>(BURMESTER, 2016)</cite>. Design
        thinking, on
        the other hand, is a more general approach to innovation that is not restricted to digital products. It, thus,
        has a far wider range of application. According to IDEO, the end goal of design thinking is the creation of
        innovative products that allow “people [to] find the sweet spot of feasibility, viability and desirability while
        considering the real needs and desires of people” <cite>(IDEO, N.D.)</cite>.

        Similar to HCD, design thinking is not to be seen as a process or system that must be followed in a certain way
        but rather as a philosophy or mindset for how to approach human issues <cite>(AJ&SMART, 2018)</cite>. According
        to the
        Hasso-Plattner-Institute of Design at Stanford (d.school), design thinking can be divided into five phases:
        empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test <cite>(D.SCHOOL, N.D.) (→ FIG. 08)</cite>.</p>

    <br>

    <subtitel>Empathize</subtitel>
    <p>For the design thinking process, it is first important to gain an empathic understanding of the user and the
        problem that needs to be solved. Therefore, it is crucial to research the users to really understand their
        needs, their objectives, their thoughts, their emotions, and their struggles. This can be achieved by observing
        the user, engaging with the user, or a combination of both <cite>(D.SCHOOL, N.D.)</cite>>.</p>

    <subtitel>Define</subtitel>
    <p>The second stage is dedicated to defining the problem. This is accomplished by compiling information gained
        throughout the empathizing phase. This widespread information is then analyzed and synthesized to define the
        core problems of the user. Defining the problem through a problem statement will help during the design process
        to address the relevant problems at any given time without losing focus or straying from the main objective.
        Defining the problem is about bringing clarity and focus to the design process <cite>(D.SCHOOL, N.D.)</cite>>.
    </p>

    <subtitel>Ideate</subtitel>
    <p>After gaining a solid understanding of the users and their problems, potential ideas for the identified problems
        are explored. Ideation is about pushing for the widest possible range of ideas to select the best solution for
        the given problem <cite>(D.SCHOOL, N.D.)</cite>>.
    </p>

    <dt><subtitel>Prototype</subtitel></dt>>
    <dd>Prototyping involves experimentation and turning ideas into tangible products. A prototype is a scaled-down
        version of a product that incorporates the potential solutions identified in the previous stages. Prototypes are
        created to communicate ideas to users <cite>(D.SCHOOL, N.D.)</cite>.</dd>

    <subtitel>Test</subtitel>
    <p>Testing the prototypes allows the designers to gain valuable feedback from real users. It is also another
        opportunity to understand the user, but unlike the initial empathize phase, the insights gained from the
        preceding phases facilitate a deeper and more realistic understanding of the user. This newfound empathy and
        knowledge can be used in subsequent iterations to refine a product to its maximum potential <cite>(D.SCHOOL,
            N.D.)</cite>.
            <br>
        For the concept of this thesis, design thinking will be applied to find a creative solution on how to support
        the user’s participation in team sports. Based on that solution, HCD will guide the design process to ensure
        high-quality user experience and usability. Furthermore, the principles of community-centered design will be
        used to emphasize sociability throughout the concept.
